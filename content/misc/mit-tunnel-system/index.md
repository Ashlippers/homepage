## MIT Tunnel System

MIT has an extensive tunnel system connecting most buildings in the main
campus and some buildings near Kendall. You can walk from Kendall T all the
way to building 7 without getting exposed to the elements, which comes pretty
handy during summer and winter.

### Navigating the Tunnels

MIT Facilities published [a map](http://web.mit.edu/facilities/maps/mit_Tunnel_map.pdf)
of the tunnel system. There are signs at most intersections and building
entrances, making navigation a lot easier.

I'm also thinking about building an app to navigate the tunnels, using
inertial navigation, WiFi fingerprint and compass. Hope I'll get the time...
