## MIT Tunnel System

MIT has an extensive tunnel system connecting most buildings in the main
campus and some buildings near Kendall. You can walk from Kendall T all the
way to building 7 without getting exposed to the elements, which comes pretty
handy during summer and winter.

### Navigating the Tunnels

MIT Facilities published [a map](http://web.mit.edu/facilities/maps/mit_Tunnel_map.pdf)
of the tunnel system. There are signs at most intersections and building
entrances, making navigation a lot easier. Also, the tunnels are laid right
under the buildings either along east-west or north-south, so the compass in
the smart phone can be very helpful..

I'm also thinking about building an app to navigate the tunnels, using
accelerometer, WiFi fingerprint and compass. Hope I'll have the time...
