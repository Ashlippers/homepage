## Exploring Stata

I find the Ray and Maria Stata Center quite exciting to me. Besides the
exterior, the inner space has much to explore. I'll note down my findings
as a newcomer here on this page.

### Bathrooms

In the G-Tower (at least floor 8 and 9), the size of bathrooms are
unbalanced. For instance, G9 has a very small men's room and a large
women's room, and vice versa for G8. It should be easier to walk up or down
the stairs to the next floor (there are two stairs in the G-Tower)
than waiting.

### Vending Machines

There are vending machines in the basement [tunnels]({{< relref "/misc/mit-tunnel-system" >}}). Just go down the stairs next to
room 155.
