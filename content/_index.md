## Introduction

### About me

I'm an incoming PhD student in Computer Science. This fall I'll be joining the [Networks and Mobile Systems Group](http://nms.csail.mit.edu) (<font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#FF0000">N</font><font color="#009900">M</font><font color="#3333FF">S</font></b></font>) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/)'s [Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu) (<img src="./MIT_logo.svg" class="inline-logo" alt="MIT" height="1em"> <img src="./CSAIL_logo.svg" class="inline-logo" alt="CSAIL" height="1em">). My research is focused on Computer Networks and Networked Systems. Currently, I'm finishing my undergraduate study at Department of Computer Science, Peking University. I'm graduating this July.

Technology fascinates me a lot, and I am most interested in networks, opensource and electronics. For relaxation, I enjoy hiking and travelling. I'm also a fan of railway and aviation. Plus, I am a licensed amateur radio operator. My callsign is BH1UNB. Check out [my profile](https://www.qrz.com/db/BH1UNB) in the QRZ.com database.
