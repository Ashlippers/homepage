### About me

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the [Networks and Mobile Systems
Group](http://nms.csail.mit.edu) (<font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><font

color="#3333FF">S</font></b></font>) of [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/)'s
[Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu)
(CSAIL). My research is focused on Computer Networks and Networked Systems.

Technology fascinates me a lot, and I am most interested in networks,
opensource and electronics. I also enjoy hiking, cycling and travelling.
Plus, I am a licensed amateur radio operator. My callsign is BH1UNB. Check
