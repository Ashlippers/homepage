It sends data every 10 minutes to the APRS-IS (Internet Service) server. All you need to build a weather station are an Arduino board, a W5100 Ethernet Shield, a DHT21 temp/humidity sensor and a BMP085 barometric pressure sensor. For detailed info about building and troubleshooting, feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\nThe code of this project is coded by Weng Kai (BA5AG) and me. The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/yangl1996/aprswxbox).\r\n\r\n###Preparation for a Weather Station\r\n* a Mac or a PC\r\n* Arduino IDE (ver 1.00 or later) installed on your computer\r\n* a USB cable\r\n* a router\r\n* a power supply\r\n* an Arduino board\r\n* an W5100 Ethernet Shield\r\n* a DHT21 sensor\r\n* a BMP085 sensor\r\n\r\n###Setting-up guide\r\nSetting up an APRS Weather station is as easy as connecting a few wires. It's quite simple. It takes about 15 minutes to complete the whole process following this guide.\r\n\r\nFirst, plug the Ethernet Shield on the Arduino. Connect the Arduino to a computer and load the code. You need to modify the code to make it sending beacons with your callsign and location. Edit \"callsign\", \"passcode\" and \"location\". \"Passcode\" is a unique 5-dig number that is only valid with your callsign to ensure your identity of an amateur radio operator. If you haven't got one, there're many HAMs who provide free passcode calculating. As for location, you may check Google Maps or other map service. Be sure to input your location in the correct format (like the default location in the code). Change the APRS-IS server when necessary (e.g. when the default server is down).\r\n\r\nThen, link the two sensors to proper pins shown in the connection graph. You may take necessary measures to avoid unexpected disconnection.\r\n\r\nThird, connect the Weather Box to your router or switch. Turn on the power. Check if your station \"CALLSIGN-13\" is shown properly on the APRS-IS network (e.g. check aprs.fi and search for your callsign). It it appears, congratulations! If not, try to follow the troubleshooting guide below.\r\n\r\n###Troubleshooting\r\nIf your Weather Box doesn't work or doesn't work properly, try to follow these detailed steps.\r\n\r\n1. Connect your Weather Box to your computer with Ethernet cable plugged in.\r\n1. Open Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.\r\n1. Turn on the power.\r\n1. Check the message shown in the Serial Moniter window. \r\n\r\n\r\n* If it is related to connection failure, check if the server address is correct.\r\n* Messages related to logging failure may be result of incorrect callsign and passcode.\r\n* If a \"DHT Failure\" or \"BMP Failure\" message is shown, check the sensor connection. A broken wire is a common cause.\r\n* As for \"Init Failure\", it means Weather Box cannot automatically get IP address from your router. Check if the DHCP function on your router is on.\r\n\r\nIf you are still stuck in problems not mentioned above, feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\n###Resources\r\nA connection graph and the source code are provided on GitHub.
