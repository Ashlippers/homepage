## Introduction

### About me

I'm an undergraduate student at Department of Computer Science, Peking University, and a research intern at school's Center for Energy-efficient Computing and Applications. You can find me on the lab's website [here](http://ceca.pku.edu.cn/en/team.php?action=show&member_id=199). I also work as a network administrator at school's Network Operations Center. This fall I'll be joining the [Networks and Mobile Systems Group](http://nms.csail.mit.edu) (<font face="Trebuchet MS"><b><font color="#FF0000">N</font><font color="#009900">M</font><font color="#3333FF">S</font></b></font>) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/)'s [Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu) (<img src="static/MIT_logo.svg" alt="MIT" height="1em"> <img src="static/CSAIL.svg" alt="CSAIL" height="1em">). My research is focused on Computer Networks and Networked Systems.

Technology fascinates me a lot, and I am most interested in networks, opensource and electronics. For relaxation, I enjoy hiking and travelling. I'm also a fan of railway, aviation and Japanese animes. Plus, I am a licensed amateur radio operator. My callsign is BH1UNB.
