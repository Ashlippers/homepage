This work is our HackPKU 2017 project, completed with Zhizhao Liu, Minghui Chen and Luyang Zhu.

We use Leap Motion to detect user hand movements and feed the data into a Javascript application. User gestures are used to
control the cursors to follow the beats of the music, replicating the gameplay of the music game "OSU!".

To set up, simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser. Leap Motion and SDK is essential to run the game.
