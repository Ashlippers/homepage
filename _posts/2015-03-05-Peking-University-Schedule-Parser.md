## Introduction

Schedule Parser is a simple Python program, which reads HTML file of class schedule table from elective.pku.edu.cn and encodes .ics file,
making it simple to import class schedule into Apple Calendar, Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook, etc.

## Dependency

The script only depends on Python standard libraries.

## Usage

Schedule Parser is based on Python3, so it should work fine on Python version 3.0 or higher. It is a simple command-line tool so just run

```
python3 parser.py
```

in Terminal.
