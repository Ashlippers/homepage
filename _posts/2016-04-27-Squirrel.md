introduction: Squirrel is a lightweight file sharing tool I wrote for my own needs in Peking University Cluster Competition Team.

Our cluster competition team holds discussions regularly, and I want to make the discussion slides available to all team
members, while keeping it protected from the public. However, all existing file sharing tools are way too heavy for my
simple needs. So I decided to write one.

When building the tool, I follow these principals:

- Lightweight -- provide no fancy functions but just the very basic ones
- Simple to use -- users can get things done within several clicks or taps
- Fast to deploy -- just grab the code, do few essential configurations and rock'n'roll
- Fit in my workflow -- easy to upload files and to maintain the site

I write the app with Javascript and Node.js, now I've completed a basic version and it's been put into use in our cluster
competition team. Still, I've got a few ideas to improve it:

- Integrate with Git: use a Git repository to hold the files and their metadata (maybe in the commit messages), so adding
a file will be as easy as ``git commit``
- Integrate with GitHub: sync the local repository with GitHub so we can upload files with its web frontend, and let this
app do the permission control stuff
- A simple news board: post news and notices on it, and we get an essential team work site that fits in our workflow
