This work is our HackPKU 2017 project, completed with Zhizhao Liu, Minghui Chen and Luyang Zhu.

We use Leap Motion to detect user hand movements and feed the data into a Javascript application. User gestures are used to
control the cursors to follow the beats of the music, replicating the gameplay of the music game "OSU!". The whole application
excluding the music and game map was completed by us within the 48-hour competition period.

To set up, simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser. Leap Motion and SDK are essential to run the game.
