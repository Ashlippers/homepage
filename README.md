# Lei Yang's Homepage

This repository holds the Jekyll source of [my homepage](http://www.yangl1996.com). The theme is based on GitHub Pages' "[Minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal)".

## How to build your own

Like my homepage? Thanks! Would like to build your own? Then __please, do not just copy the master branch.__ Instead, _understand how [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) works_ and _use the [`starter-template`](https://github.com/yangl1996/homepage/tree/starter-template) branch_. Thank you!
